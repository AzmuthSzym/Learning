History and Bitcoin as a State Transition System:
The concept of decentralized digital currency has been around for decades and from that point people have been introducing new concepts on top of it, but Bitcoin was the first
one to be implemented in practice by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 and served as a state transition system (for each input in a transaction there can be an error or a change in state).

Mining and Merkle Trees:
Mining is a process of adding a new block to the already existing chain through the solution of proof-of-work (nodes 'guessing' the correct hash) with some other steps in order to 
provide a secure solution, while usage of Merkle Trees solves some scalability issues, because the nodes to not require massive amounts of data to be stored in order to proove 
the validity of a transaction within the blocks.

Alternative Blockchain Applications and Scripting:
The idea of building applications on top of a blockchain (for btc it can be Namecoin or Colored Coins) has been thought of even before Bitcoin was created, but the Bitcoin network
itself isn't suitable for this type of endeavour, because of the lack of state, blockchain blindness and lack of turing-completeness. Ethereum aims to provide a framework that
would solve those issues, bringing ease of development and allowing applications to share blockchain security.
